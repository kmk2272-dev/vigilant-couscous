    <P>I love the ocean, but the deep sea feels like a completely seperate entity from the typical oceans that we think about. The deep sea holds creatures never seen to man, things beyond our imaginations that are just floating aimlessly in the deep ocean as we speak. I am very interested in learning more about the ecosystem of this environment but also the individual creatures that lives here. I began my process by getting a good footing on syntax and file location in html and css. I then began to link images along with associated websites as a place for research and curiosity to emerge. With the color scheme I thought it would be interesting to play with similar light conditions of the deep ocean which is pitch black. The color scheme of black with hints of blue made me decide on oranage as the text color because it is a complementary color. However, after finishing the task, the site seemed unprofessional so I made a variant that catered to the modern corporate look with clean white space. However the type face was a place to further explore in the semester as the the sophistacated look using serif fonts made it look rather unfinished compared to the sans serif fonts. I had fun with the cursor being a little  fish almost as if you are exploring the sea along side them. </P>
<p>I later then experimented with different navigation styles. One as a grid and the other as a scroll. I personally liked the navigability of the scroll but it was not visually pleasing. However I believe there is a possibility to push this further and explore the idea of how nvaigating a website can be more spatial like a drag method to orient yourself around the space.</p>
